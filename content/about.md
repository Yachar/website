Contemporary artist and cultural operator, I graduated from the École Supérieure d'Art (Higher school of arts) of Aix-en-Provence in 2015. Interested in the impact of the environment and time on the inner process of perception of the real world, as well as on the construction of human identity. Attracted by the relationship between identity and landscape, especially in its sound aspect.

It was while working on soundscapes and the notion of time in the present time that the sonification1 of environmental data has became a coherent way to find the sensory capability that we need as a "dominant" species. Auditory communication could be a crucial and very touching way for finding our place in today's fast-paced world. It could be also the key element for regaining and maintaining the lost connection with "nature". Through sonification we could become aware of our impact on the planet in ways that wasn’t possible before.

In this respect, it can play an important role in combating the intellectual and political separation between society and nature. It is important to mention that it is this "vision of Nature as external is a fundamental condition for capital accumulation". (Moore JW. 2015) and capitalism as the underlying reason for the contemporary climate and identity crisis.

*Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data.
