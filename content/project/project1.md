##Wind water witness

> “Wind water witness” is inspired from the mechanics of movement in fluid matters also found in the movement pattern of fleeing people in the streets of Tehran during Iran’s 2009 Green movement. Here, the installation consists of water droplets that create an analogue generative drawing (mostly horizontal lines on the glass sheet) made possible by the pressure of the blowing air on the surface of the glass sheet. The result is a stormy experience due to the wind, in contrast to the lightness of the transparent materials - i.g. water, glass, water and air - in an auto generative process of delicate droplets drawing on the glass sheet. A moment to live in and to witness.
