      <description>temporary image   Wind water witness  Kinetic Installation
Glass sheet, Turbin, Water, Metalic cables
2013
  “Wind water witness” is inspired from the mechanics of movement in fluid matters also found in the movement pattern of fleeing people in the streets of Tehran during Iran’s 2009 Green movement. Here, the installation consists of water droplets that create an analogue generative drawing (mostly horizontal lines on the glass sheet) made possible by the pressure of the blowing air on the surface of the glass sheet.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Contemporary artist and cultural operator, I graduated from the École Supérieure d&amp;rsquo;Art (Higher school of arts) of Aix-en-Provence in 2015. Interested in the impact of the environment and time on the inner process of perception of the real world, as well as on the construction of human identity. Attracted by the relationship between identity and landscape, especially in its sound aspect.
It was while working on soundscapes and the notion of time in the present time that the sonification1 of environmental data has became a coherent way to find the sensory capability that we need as a &amp;ldquo;dominant&amp;rdquo; species.</description>
